<h1>Linked List</h1>
This code provides a comprehensive implementation of a linked list in Python, 
making it easy for someone who is not familiar with coding to understand the 
basic concept and functionality of this data structure.


<h1>Double Linked List</h1>
This code provides a robust implementation of a doubly linked list in Python, 
enabling someone who is not familiar with coding to understand the fundamental 
concept and capabilities of this data structure. The inclusion of methods for 
various common operations makes it a versatile tool for managing and manipulating 
data in a doubly linked list format.


<h1>Stack</h1>
There is elegance and flexibility in implementing a stack using a linked list. In 
this brief snippet of code I explore how this approach harnesses the dynamic nature 
of linked lists to overcome the limitations of size predefinition, a common setback 
in stack implementation. The core stack operationsâ€”push and pop are implemented here 
in many ways similar to a normal linked list.
