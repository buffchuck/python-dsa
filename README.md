<h1>Linked List</h1>
This code provides a comprehensive implementation of a linked list in Python, 
making it easy for someone who is not familiar with coding to understand the 
basic concept and functionality of this data structure.


<h1>Double Linked List</h1>
This code provides a robust implementation of a doubly linked list in Python, 
enabling someone who is not familiar with coding to understand the fundamental 
concept and capabilities of this data structure. The inclusion of methods for 
various common operations makes it a versatile tool for managing and manipulating 
data in a doubly linked list format.


<h1>Stack</h1>
There is elegance and flexibility in implementing a stack using a linked list. In 
this brief snippet of code I explore how this approach harnesses the dynamic nature 
of linked lists to overcome the limitations of size predefinition, a common setback 
in stack implementation. The core stack operationsâ€”push and pop are implemented here 
in many ways similar to a normal linked list. 


<h1>Queue</h1>
This is my implementation of a queue using a linked list. A Queue is a type of abstract data type or a collection in computer science where the entities in the collection are kept in order. It is also known as a linear data structure, or more precisely a sequential collection.

The queue follows a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) methodology. The element that is inserted first is also the one that gets deleted first. In simpler words, the element that is added at the end of the queue is the first one to be removed.

A real-life example of a queue can be a single-lane one-way road, where the vehicle enters first, exits first. More examples can be seen in the real world when a new iPhone launches, people stand in a line or queue in front of the store. The first one to stand in line will get the iPhone first.

The basic operations that can be performed on a queue data structure are:

Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
IsFull: Check if the queue is full.
Peek/Top: Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it.
These operations make a queue a LIFO data structure. There are different types of queues: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue, and Deque (Double Ended Queue). Each of these queues is designed to be used in specific situations.
